# GitHub Actions Fix Summary

## ðŸš¨ Issue Identified
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing because:
- GitHub Actions runner had Dart SDK 3.2.6
- Our pubspec.yaml required Dart SDK >=3.4.0
- This caused version solving to fail

## âœ… Fix Applied

### 1. Updated SDK Versions
**Before:**
```yaml
environment:
  sdk: '>=3.4.0 <4.0.0'
  flutter: ">=3.24.0"
```

**After:**
```yaml
environment:
  sdk: '>=3.2.0 <4.0.0'
  flutter: ">=3.16.0"
```

### 2. Added GitHub Actions Workflow
Created `.github/workflows/wasm-build.yml` with:
- Flutter 3.32.8 setup
- Web build with WASM support
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Artifact management

## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits

### Compatibility
- âœ… Works with GitHub Actions environment
- âœ… Maintains WASM functionality
- âœ… Compatible with local development
- âœ… Supports CI/CD pipeline

### Features Preserved
- âœ… WebAssembly compilation
- âœ… Offline functionality
- âœ… Progressive Web App features
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility

## ðŸ“‹ Workflow Steps

1. **Setup**: Flutter 3.32.8 with web support
2. **Build**: WASM compilation with CanvasKit
3. **Deploy**: Automatic GitHub Pages deployment
4. **Artifacts**: Build files available for download

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Monitor**: Watch the GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Test**: Verify deployment on GitHub Pages
3. **Optimize**: Fine-tune build performance
4. **Scale**: Add more deployment options

## âœ… Verification

- âœ… Local build tested and working
- âœ… Dependencies resolved successfully
- âœ… WASM compilation successful
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflow created
- âœ… Changes committed and pushed

**The GitHub Actions build should now pass successfully!** ðŸŽ‰
